## hapi-react-kit
A hapijs server and React client boilerplate project.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gjunkie/hapi-react-kit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gjunkie/hapi-react-kit)

## Motivation

This little project got started out of a need to have an up-to-date boilerplate that didn't have the client and server-side logic tied up. Most boilerplate projects coupled them pretty tightly and made replacing their respective frameworks pretty cumbersome. I'm a huge fan of Hapijs and I've been learning a bit of React lately, so I figured I'd start there. Feel free to clone this and swap them out for your preferred frameworks.

## Installation

- clone repo.
- `cd hapi-react-kit`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- open second terminal window.
- `cd hapi-react-kit/server`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- visit `http://localhost:8080`

## Thoughts
This boilerplate puts together the client and the server as a proof of concept. The two should be in separate repos and deployed separately.

## Tests
There's some basic tests with mocha to get you started.

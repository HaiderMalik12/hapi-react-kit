## hapi-react-kit
A hapijs server and React client boilerplate project.

## Motivation

This little project got started out of a need to have an up-to-date boilerplate that didn't have the client and server-side logic tied up. Most boilerplate projects coupled them pretty tightly and made replacing their respective frameworks pretty cumbersome. I'm a huge fan of Hapijs and I've been learning a bit of React lately, so I figured I'd start there. Feel free to clone this and swap them out for your preferred frameworks.
